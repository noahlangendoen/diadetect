# diadetect

## Summary:
Diadetect is a diabetes prediction model that was built in a team-format during the Fall 2024 Semester. I worked collaboratively with Pat Patwary and Visho Malla Oli (https://github.com/vishomallaoli). Our project was divided into two parts. First, Visho took the dataset that was provided by Pat, and performed an extensive analysis on the data. This began the process of feature engineering, and all of Visho's work can be viewed in the 543_diadetect_dp.ipynb file. After Visho was done with the data, I was assigned to take over the model development process. I decided on multiple models to perform a baseline analysis and determine which models I would perform further model development on. All of this work can be viewed in the 543_diadetect_mle.ipynb file.
